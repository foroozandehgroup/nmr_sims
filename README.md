# nmr\_sims

NMR simulations in Python by Simon.

Some rather simple simulations of basic NMR pulse sequences.

Everything uses the Zeeman basis in Hilbert space, so nothing too fancy is possible.

Currently have pulse-acquire and 2DJ code available.

Install with `$pip install nmr-sims`

To get started, take a look at (and run) run `$python -m nmr_sims pa` or `$python -m nmr_sims jres`.
